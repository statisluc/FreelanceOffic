// 1) What do you charge based on?
// I charge based on time, effort, and quality put into the project. Please see my pricing page HERE_link.
// 2) What if I want my website to look a specific way?
// I have video conference consultation calls where we can discuss the specifics of the website design and layout. Every new client gets a free 15 minutes. After that, these are
// $15 per hour, with a $5 down payment to start the meeting. Upon receiving this payment, we can schedule the minutes or hours of the meeting
// and how much the total cost will be (subtract the $5 down payment). Failure to make the $5 deposit will result in no appointment being reached, and failure to pay for the meeting will result in termination of our partnership.
// 3) I found a bug in the website! What can I do?
// Bugs are common and part of the software development cycle. For every website I make, I offer a 2 week warranty from date of deploymnet. This is your opportunity to "break" the website and report to me your findings. Any bug found after these two weeks can be resolved by me for $30, or $25 per hour of work, whichever greater.
// 4) I hate this website/I don't need a website anymore. Can I get my money back?
// Can I get my time back? As much as it may be inconvenient, all sales are final. The time and energy I invest into these websites cannot be refunded, hence I cannot offer refunds to anyone who has already initiated a website using my services. In extreme cases I may offer an exception, but this is not to be considered.
