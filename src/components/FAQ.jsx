          I charge based on time, effort, and quality put into the project.

      a: (
        <>
          Unless we're talking about buying or selling cars, negotiation is
          limited. However, I am always willing to help my clients. Sure, we
          might be able to talk a few numbers, but most of the prices I give you
          (and the prices seen in our PriceChecker) are firm. Please{" "}

      q: "3) What if I want my website to look a specific way?",
      a: "I have video conference consultation calls where we can discuss the specifics of the website design and layout. Every new client gets a free 30 minutes. After that, these are $15 per hour. Rate is calculated by total time expended. Additional consultation time is billed at $15/hour in 30-minute increments, and paid upfront before continuing our session. You will always be reminded at the 25 minute mark.",
    },
    {
      q: "4) I hate this website/I don't need a website anymore. Can I get my money back?",
      a: "Due to the custom nature of my work, all sales are final, and I cannot offer full refunds after work has begun. Partial refunds may be considered at my discretion depending on progress and circumstances.",
    },
    {
      q: "5) I found a bug in the website! What can I do?",
      a: (
        <>
          Bugs are common and part of the software development cycle. For every
          website I make, I offer a 2 week warranty from date of deployment.
          This is your opportunity to "break" the website and report to me your
          findings. Any bug found <strong>after</strong> these two weeks can be
          resolved by me for $30 per each bug, or $25 per hour of work,
          depending on scope and complexity of the issue.
          <div></div>
          <i>
            Note: Each website undergoes extensive testing not just by me but
            also may be reviewed by additional testers. This ensures the site is
            thoroughly checked from multiple perspectives before it ever reaches
            your hand.{" "}
          </i>
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      q: "6) How do you make your websites?",
      a: " My websites are always made with ReactJS (HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript). For E-commernce websites, I may use an extension like Stripe or Shopify- but that is the only time I will be using anything external like that. I do not work with Framer, Wix, Google Sites, unless certain circumstances. Implementation of backend (like for contact pages and checkout pages) varies.",
    },
    {
      q: " 7) I already have another website that I want tweaked. Can you edit it for me?",
      a: " I make all my websites from scratch. I can use assets from your previous website by eyeballing, but I do not modify someone else's work at this moment. If we're talking about a minor change, contact me and I can see what I can do for you. Rarely will I reformat an entire website, only parts at most.",
    },
    {
      q: "8) What websites are you not willing to work on?",
      a: "I'm willing to tackle anything you throw on me. I am very transparent if there is something I cannot do, or will take me longer to do. Very rarely do I straight up refuse to make a website for someone, regardless of the subject matter.",
    },
    {
      q: "9) How long will it take for you to make a website?",
      a: "All my websites are handmade (ReactJS). I do not use any drag and drop software or shortcuts. I also try to do a lot of bug testing and checking myself. Furthermore, at the time, I have other things going on in my life like my career and personal life. Your website cannot not be done in two or three days or sometimes even a week. Depending on the complexity of the website, or what you want, I will give you a timeframe. I will always communicate and be transparent with my clients. If something will take me a whole month, I will tell you it will take me a whole month",
    },
    {
      q: "10) How do you accept payments?",
      a: (
        <>
          I only take payments via PayPal, Cashapp, and Venmo. Only those who I
          personally know may send me money on Zelle or drop off cash. I take
          60% of the money upfront, the remaining 40% after the job is finished
          but before transferring ownership of the site. Ownership is only
          granted after full payment. This is simply to protect myself and my
          clients, and establish a mutual trust. Creation of website only begins
          after upfront payment is made. Transfer of website only occurs after
          remaining payment is made. Until full payment is made, the website
          remains my intellectual property, and may be reformatted to fit a
          website of another client. There will be a formal contract{" "}
          <strong>EVERY</strong> client must sign before any kind of work
          begins. This contract will showcase the service level agreement we
          have with our clients.{" "}
        </>
      ),

    {
      q: "11) Do you work on/develop mobile apps?",
      a: "At this current moment, I do not. If I were to start to offer my app development services in the future, it would primarily be iOS apps for Apple devices via Swift/SwiftUI. I know that going from React to React Native is pretty intuitive, but it is not something that interests me at this moment.",
