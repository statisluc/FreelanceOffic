notes:

disable highligting of text
fix the breathing arrow that should appear under the first h1 text (this should be in the same parallaxlayer component so it matches)


screenshot of screen working on that exact website lmfao (landing page screenshot on the mac)

"This could be your website", text matching the background with black outline, white background button that links to pricing

have three cards appear horizontally across the page. one of them is for pricing, the second is for FAQ, third is contact
