notes:

change the length of parallax from 8 pages to something much shorter. dont require the user to scroll as much.
make sure the screenshot image stays put for the most part!

disable highligting of text

incorporate react router to accesss other pages watching this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c02YoWR9gSY&t=35s

see if you can make the gradient apply across the entire page 

decrease number of parallax pages as well

screenshot of screen working on that exact website lmfao (landing page screenshot on the mac)

"This could be your website", text matching the background with black outline, white background button that links to pricing

have three cards appear horizontally across the page. one of them is for pricing, the second is for FAQ, third is contact 

at the end have your information, email, github, yee
